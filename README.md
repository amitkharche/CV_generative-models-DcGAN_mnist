# 🧠 Project 8: generative-models-dcgan

## 🎯 Scope
DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) for image generation using the MNIST dataset.

---

## 💼 Business Use Case

Generative models like DCGAN are widely used for:
- **Data augmentation** for imbalanced datasets
- **Synthetic sample generation** in privacy-constrained environments
- **AI creativity tools** like art and digit generation
- Prototyping for **style transfer** and image-to-image translation tasks

This project demonstrates how DCGAN can be trained on handwritten digits to produce synthetic but realistic outputs.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model

```bash
python -m src.train
```

This will:
- Train DCGAN on MNIST
- Save model checkpoints and image samples to `output/`

---

## 🌐 Launch Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```

- Use the slider to choose how many digits to generate
- Click **Generate** to view model output in real time
